\title{Compose Multiple Solvers Sequentially}
\usage{
compose(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Solver functions to compose}
}
\value{
A new solver function that runs all solvers in sequence
}
\description{
Chains any number of solvers sequentially. Each solver's result becomes
the starting point for the next. Alternative to using \code{\%>>\%} operator.
}
\details{
Trace data from all solvers is merged into a single trace with stage
boundaries preserved.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Three-stage strategy
strategy <- compose(
  grid_search(n = 5),
  gradient_ascent(max_iter = 50),
  newton_raphson(max_iter = 20)
)
result <- strategy(problem, theta0)
}
