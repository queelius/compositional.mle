  "description": "Composable optimization strategies for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Solvers are first-class functions that combine via sequential chaining, parallel racing, and random restarts. Implements gradient ascent, Newton-Raphson, quasi-Newton (BFGS), and derivative-free methods with support for constrained optimization and tracing.",
